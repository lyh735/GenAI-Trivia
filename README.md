Our mission:
We have built a website to explore the topic of overreliance of AI and how it might affect humanity. Research has shown that humans rely and trust AI, even though they might be wrong; and this usually happens when AI sounds sounds too confident giving out the wrong answer. 
Through this website, we hope to protect humanity from eroding critical thinking cause by overreliance of AI. We urged users not to trust AI, blindly and courage, independent thought, inform decision-making and responsible tech use.

Tech stack:
We keep the stack simple by using the fundamentals of web develop so that the focus stays on the message we are trying to convey. Scenario is built on a separate HTML page. CSS helps us to keep our design and aesthetics consistent. JavaScript is use to simulate different AI behaviour.

Declaration of AI : used in this project for debugging and code formatting alignment. All generated will reviewed by developers.
(Yes we use AI to help us convince users to not rely on AI, you can say we made it self sabotage :3)
